## 🎯 Core Strategy

### The One-and-Done Rule
Each player can only be used **once** across all playoff weeks. This requires careful planning:

1. **Week 1 (Wild Card)**: Use players from teams likely to be eliminated early
2. **Week 2 (Divisional)**: Mix of remaining wild card winners and divisional teams
3. **Week 3 (Conference)**: Deploy Ravens and Lions stars (predicted to lose)
4. **Week 4 (Super Bowl)**: All-in on Chiefs (predicted champions)

### Win/Loss Predictions
Based on team strength and playoff history:
- **Wild Card Winners**: Texans, Ravens, Bills, Eagles, Commanders, Rams
- **Divisional Winners**: Chiefs, Ravens, Lions, Eagles
- **Conference Winners**: Chiefs (AFC), Eagles (NFC)
- **Super Bowl Winner**: Chiefs

## 🔑 Key Strategic Decisions

### Why Use Chargers/Steelers/Broncos in Week 1?
These teams lost in the Wild Card round. Using their players early preserves elite talent from advancing teams.

### Why Heavy Eagles Stack in Week 2?
Eagles advance but are predicted to lose in Conference Championship, making Week 2 the optimal time to use Hurts, Brown, and Smith.

### Why Save Chiefs Until Week 4?
Chiefs are predicted to win the Super Bowl, so having Mahomes, Kelce, and the full offensive stack for the championship game maximizes points when it matters most.

## 📈 Competitive Advantage

1. **No Player Waste**: Every player used strategically based on team's playoff longevity
2. **PPR Optimization**: Heavy use of pass-catching RBs and TEs (1.5 PPR)
3. **Championship Stack**: Full Chiefs correlation in Super Bowl
4. **Balanced Risk**: Mix of safe floor players and boom/bust upside

## 🎮 How to Use These Rosters

1. Review each weekly roster file before the games
2. Check for any last-minute injury updates
3. Submit your lineup before the first game of each playoff round
4. Track points throughout the week
5. Celebrate your winnings! 💵

## 📞 Questions or Adjustments?

If you need to make changes due to:
- Player injuries
- Different playoff results than predicted
- Last-minute lineup decisions

Simply refer back to the core strategy: use eliminated team players first, save championship-bound players for later rounds.
